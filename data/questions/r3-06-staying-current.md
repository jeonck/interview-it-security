# Question

How do you stay updated with the rapidly changing security landscape?

# Answer

"I maintain a multi-channel approach to continuous learning. I'm an active member of professional communities like ISACA and (ISC)2, and attend major conferences like Black Hat, DEF CON, and RSA annually. I dedicate time each week to reviewing threat intelligence reports from sources like Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and CISA. I follow key security researchers on social media and participate in CTF competitions to keep technical skills sharp. Within my team, I encourage knowledge sharing through internal security briefings and post-incident learning sessions. I also maintain relationships with peers at other companies to share threat intelligence informally. Staying current isn't optional in security - it's survival."
