# Question

What is your approach to securing a large-scale server infrastructure in a semiconductor manufacturing environment?

# Answer

"I prioritize a Zero Trust Architecture. In a manufacturing context, this means strict micro-segmentation between the corporate network and the Fab (Production) network. I focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM), ensuring 'Least Privilege' access. Additionally, I implement continuous monitoring and automated patch management for servers, ensuring that security updates don't disrupt high-availability production requirements."
