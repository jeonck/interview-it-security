# Question

Tell me about a time you managed a critical security breach. How did you lead your team through it?

# Answer

"In my previous role, we detected a sophisticated ransomware attempt targeting our production servers. I immediately convened a cross-functional task force, isolating affected segments to prevent lateral movement. I acted as the bridge between the technical team and executive leadership, providing clear updates while allowing my engineers to focus on root cause analysis. We successfully restored the systems from backups within 4 hours with zero data loss. Post-incident, I led a 'blameless post-mortem' to strengthen our firewall policies and identity management."
