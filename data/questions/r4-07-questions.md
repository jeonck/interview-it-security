# Question

Do you have any final questions for us?

# Answer

"Yes, I have a few questions: First, what does 'success' look like for this role in the first 90 days? I want to ensure I'm aligned with your expectations from day one. Second, what are the biggest challenges the security team is currently facing with the Texas expansion? Understanding these will help me hit the ground running. Third, how does the security team collaborate with the manufacturing and engineering teams here? And finally, what's the path for growth and development at Samsung for someone in this role? I'm committed to a long-term career here and want to understand how I can continue to grow and contribute."
