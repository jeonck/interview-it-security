# Question

How do you communicate complex security risks to non-technical stakeholders or executives?

# Answer

"I avoid technical jargon and focus on business impact, risk levels, and ROI. For instance, instead of explaining 'CVE vulnerabilities,' I discuss the potential for production downtime and its financial implications. I use visual dashboards to show our current security posture against industry benchmarks. My goal is to empower executives to make informed decisions by framing security as an enabler of business continuity rather than a bottleneck."
