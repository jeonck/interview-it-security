# Question

How do you handle a high-performing engineer who has a negative attitude?

# Answer

"I address it privately and immediately - attitude issues tend to spread if left unchecked. I have a direct conversation explaining the specific behaviors I've observed and their impact on team morale and productivity. I emphasize that at Samsung, collaboration is as important as technical output - we succeed as a team, not as individuals. I set clear behavioral expectations alongside their technical KPIs and establish regular check-ins to monitor progress. If the behavior continues despite coaching, I document everything and work with HR on appropriate next steps. A toxic high-performer can do more damage than a struggling team player."
