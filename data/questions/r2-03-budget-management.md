# Question

Describe your experience with budget management for security tools.

# Answer

"I focus on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), not just license fees. I evaluate tools based on integration capabilities with our existing stack, how much manual work they automate, and the hidden costs of implementation and training. When presenting to leadership, I always show a clear ROI calculation - for example, 'This $200K SOAR platform will reduce incident response time by 60%, saving an estimated $500K annually in potential breach costs and analyst overtime.' I also advocate for platform consolidation where possible, reducing vendor sprawl and operational complexity while negotiating enterprise agreements for better pricing."
