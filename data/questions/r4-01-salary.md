# Question

What are your salary expectations?

# Answer

"Based on my 15+ years of experience in server security and team leadership, and considering the responsibilities of a Senior Manager/Engineer Manager Level 2 role in the Texas market, I am looking for a total compensation package in the range of [Research Market Rate - e.g., $180K-$220K base]. However, I understand that compensation is more than just base salary. I'm open to discussing the complete package including benefits, equity/RSUs, signing bonus, relocation assistance, and performance bonuses. What's most important to me is finding the right fit where I can make a significant impact. I'm confident we can find terms that work for both of us."
