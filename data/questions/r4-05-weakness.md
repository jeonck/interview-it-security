# Question

What would your current supervisor say is your biggest weakness?

# Answer

"They might say I am sometimes too detail-oriented, which can slow decision-making when I'm trying to gather complete information. In security, this thoroughness is often valuable, but I've learned it can become a bottleneck. I've actively worked on this by setting time-boxes for analysis, establishing decision criteria upfront, and learning to delegate more effectively. I now focus on the 'big picture' strategic decisions while empowering my team to handle granular details with appropriate guardrails. I've also improved at distinguishing between decisions that are reversible (move fast) versus irreversible (be thorough). It's an ongoing balance, but I've made significant progress."
