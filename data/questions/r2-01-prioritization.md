# Question

How do you prioritize a security project versus a feature request from the production team?

# Answer

"I use a risk-impact matrix to make data-driven decisions. If the security gap poses a high risk to business continuity, regulatory compliance, or customer data, it takes priority. However, I don't see security and features as opposing forces. I negotiate with the production team to find a 'Security-as-a-Service' model - embedding security controls that enable their features without compromising safety. For example, instead of blocking a new integration, I might fast-track an API security gateway that serves both teams' needs. Communication is key: I always explain the 'why' behind security priorities to build trust and alignment."
