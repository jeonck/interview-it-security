# Question

Samsung values 'Speed' and 'Quality.' How do you balance these in security?

# Answer

"Security should be a 'Guardrail,' not a 'Speed Bump.' The key is shifting security left - embedding automated security checks into the CI/CD pipeline so that issues are caught early when they're cheapest to fix. By investing in security automation, policy-as-code, and self-service security tools, we enable development teams to move at high speed without sacrificing the quality of our defense. I also believe in risk-based security - not everything needs the same level of scrutiny. We focus intensive review on high-risk changes while streamlining low-risk ones. This allows us to maintain Samsung's competitive pace while ensuring our security posture remains strong."
