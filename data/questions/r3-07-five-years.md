# Question

Where do you see yourself in 5 years within Samsung?

# Answer

"In five years, I aim to have established a highly automated, resilient security operations center for Samsung's Texas facilities - one that sets the standard for semiconductor manufacturing security globally. I want to build and develop a world-class security team that becomes a talent pipeline for Samsung's broader security organization. Beyond operational excellence, I aspire to be a key strategic leader who helps Samsung navigate the evolving security challenges of AI-driven manufacturing, supply chain security, and emerging threats. I'm also interested in contributing to Samsung's global security strategy, sharing learnings from our Texas operations with facilities worldwide. My goal is to create lasting impact."
