# Question

What do you look for when hiring a security engineer for your team?

# Answer

"Beyond technical proficiency in Linux/Windows security and scripting, I look for curiosity and an 'attacker's mindset.' The security landscape changes daily, so I value candidates who are self-driven learners. I also assess their ability to work under pressure; in security, calm and methodical thinking during an incident is just as important as knowing how to code."
