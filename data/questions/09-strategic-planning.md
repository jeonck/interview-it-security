# Question

Where do you see the biggest threat to server security in the next 3 years, and how should we prepare?

# Answer

"I believe AI-driven attacks and Supply Chain vulnerabilities are the biggest threats. Attackers are using AI to find zero-day exploits faster. To prepare, we must invest in AI-driven defense mechanisms that can detect anomalous behavior in real-time. We also need to tighten our 'Software Bill of Materials' (SBOM) to ensure every third-party component in our servers is vetted and secure."
