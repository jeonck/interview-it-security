# Question

How do you keep your team motivated during high-stress incident responses?

# Answer

"I stay calm and provide clear direction to prevent 'alert fatigue' and panic. I ensure everyone knows their specific role in our incident response playbook - ambiguity creates stress. I take the heat from upper management so my team can focus on the technical work without distraction. During extended incidents, I enforce rotation schedules to prevent burnout and ensure fresh eyes on the problem. Afterward, I always recognize individual contributions publicly, conduct a blameless retrospective focused on process improvement, and ensure the team has time to decompress. Building this culture of support means people perform better under pressure because they know they're not alone."
