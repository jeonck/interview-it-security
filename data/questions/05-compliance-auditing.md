# Question

How do you ensure your server infrastructure stays compliant with local and international regulations?

# Answer

"I implement a framework of continuous compliance rather than 'point-in-time' audits. For a global company like Samsung, this involves aligning with NIST, ISO 27001, and local Texas data privacy laws. I use automated compliance-as-code tools to scan our server configurations daily. This allows us to detect and remediate any drift from our security baselines instantly."
