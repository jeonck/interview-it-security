# Question

Why Samsung? Why now?

# Answer

"Samsung is a global leader in semiconductor technology, and the Texas expansion represents a pivotal moment in the company's growth. With the CHIPS Act driving massive investment in domestic manufacturing, building world-class security infrastructure isn't just important - it's critical to national interests. I'm drawn to Samsung's culture of innovation and the scale of impact I can have here. My experience in server security and team leadership aligns perfectly with the challenges of securing advanced manufacturing facilities. I want to be part of building something significant - protecting the technology that powers the future while contributing to Samsung's mission of inspiring the world."
