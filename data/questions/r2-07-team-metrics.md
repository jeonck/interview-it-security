# Question

How do you measure the success of your security team?

# Answer

"I focus on metrics that demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness. Key indicators include: Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) - how quickly we identify threats; Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) - how fast we resolve them; the percentage of automated versus manual security tasks - showing operational maturity; vulnerability remediation SLA compliance; and false positive rates in our detection systems. Decreasing MTTR while maintaining system uptime is my primary success indicator. I also track leading indicators like security training completion rates and the number of security champions in development teams. I present these metrics monthly to leadership with trend analysis and improvement initiatives."
