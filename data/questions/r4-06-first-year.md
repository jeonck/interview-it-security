# Question

What do you want to be remembered for after your first year at Samsung?

# Answer

"I want to be known as the leader who made security a 'seamless' part of the production process - not a bottleneck, but an enabler. I want teams to see security as something that helps them move faster and more confidently, not something that slows them down. Beyond processes, I want to be remembered for building a team that is both technically elite and highly collaborative - a team that other departments want to work with. I aim to establish a culture of continuous improvement where we're always learning from incidents and getting better. If people say 'Security used to be a pain point, but now it just works,' I'll consider my first year a success."
