# Question

What is your strategy for 'Cloud Migration' from a manager's perspective?

# Answer

"I advocate for a 'Security-First' migration approach. Instead of 'Lift and Shift' which carries legacy vulnerabilities into the cloud, I ensure we re-architect applications to be cloud-native, leveraging identity-based perimeters (Zero Trust), automated compliance checks, and native cloud security services from day one. I establish a Cloud Center of Excellence with security embedded, create reusable secure landing zones and templates, and implement guardrails rather than gates - enabling teams to move fast within secure boundaries. I also ensure my team is upskilled on cloud security certifications (AWS Security Specialty, Azure Security Engineer) to support this transition effectively."
