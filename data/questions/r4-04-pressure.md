# Question

How do you handle high-pressure environments?

# Answer

"I rely on preparation and processes. When a crisis hits, I fall back on our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and incident response playbooks. This takes the guesswork out of high-stress situations and allows me to stay focused and decisive. I also practice compartmentalization - focusing on what I can control right now rather than getting overwhelmed by the bigger picture. I maintain composure because my team looks to me for stability; if I panic, they will too. Outside of incidents, I manage stress through regular exercise and ensuring I take time to recharge. I've learned that sustainable performance requires taking care of yourself so you can take care of your team."
