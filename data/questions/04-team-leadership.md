# Question

How do you handle a situation where two of your senior engineers disagree on a technical security strategy?

# Answer

"I facilitate a data-driven discussion. I ask both engineers to present their solutions based on three criteria: security efficacy, scalability, and implementation cost. If a consensus isn't reached, I encourage a small-scale POC (Proof of Concept) to test both approaches. Ultimately, as a manager, I make the final decision based on what aligns best with the company's long-term security roadmap, while ensuring both parties feel heard and respected."
