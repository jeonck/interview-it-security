# Question

Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned.

# Answer

"Earlier in my career, I deployed a critical security patch to production that caused a brief but impactful service outage. I had tested in staging, but our staging environment didn't perfectly mirror production's configuration complexity. The outage lasted 45 minutes and affected several internal teams. I learned several important lessons: first, the importance of comprehensive regression testing with production-parity environments; second, never underestimate the complexity of legacy systems and their interdependencies; third, always have a rollback plan tested and ready. This experience made me a more meticulous planner. I now advocate for canary deployments and automated rollback triggers. Failure taught me that thoroughness saves time in the long run."
