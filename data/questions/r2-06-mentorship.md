# Question

How do you mentor junior security engineers?

# Answer

"I use a mix of 'Shadowing' and 'Reverse Shadowing.' Initially, juniors shadow me during incident responses and architecture reviews to learn decision-making processes. Then I flip it - they lead while I observe and provide feedback. I assign them small but visible projects that stretch their abilities while having safety nets. I create a learning culture with weekly 'tech talks' where team members present on topics they've researched - this builds both technical depth and presentation skills. I encourage certifications (Security+, CySA+, then CISSP track) and allocate training budget accordingly. Most importantly, I normalize asking questions and making mistakes as part of growth."
