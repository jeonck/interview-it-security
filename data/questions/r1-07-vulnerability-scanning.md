# Question

What tools do you use for vulnerability scanning, and how do you handle false positives?

# Answer

"I use enterprise tools like Nessus, Qualys, or Rapid7 for infrastructure scanning, and integrate SAST/DAST tools like SonarQube and OWASP ZAP into CI/CD pipelines for application security. When a false positive is identified, I follow a structured process: verify with manual testing, document the justification with technical evidence, and create an exclusion rule with an expiration date. I re-verify exclusions quarterly to ensure the risk profile hasn't changed. I also maintain a risk acceptance log signed off by appropriate stakeholders for any accepted vulnerabilities, ensuring accountability and audit trails."
