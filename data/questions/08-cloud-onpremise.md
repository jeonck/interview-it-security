# Question

Samsung uses a hybrid environment. How do you balance security between on-premise servers and cloud instances?

# Answer

"Consistency is key. I strive for a unified security policy regardless of where the workload resides. This involves using 'Single Sign-On' (SSO) across the board and centralized logging (SIEM) to have a single pane of glass for visibility. I ensure that the security controls we have on-premise, like Deep Packet Inspection, are mirrored in the cloud using cloud-native security tools (CNAPP)."
