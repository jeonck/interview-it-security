# Question

Are you willing to relocate to Taylor/Austin, and how soon can you start?

# Answer

"Yes, I am fully committed to relocating to the Taylor/Austin area. I've already researched the region extensively - it's an exciting time to be in Central Texas with the tech and semiconductor growth happening there. I'm familiar with the communities around the Samsung facility and am genuinely excited about the move. Regarding start date, I can typically begin within 4 weeks of receiving a signed offer. This allows me to provide proper notice to my current employer and ensure a smooth, professional transition. If there's urgency, I'm willing to discuss ways to accelerate the timeline while maintaining my professional obligations."
