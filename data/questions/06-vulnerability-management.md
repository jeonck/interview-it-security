# Question

How do you prioritize patches when you have hundreds of servers and limited maintenance windows?

# Answer

"I use a risk-based prioritization strategy. I look at the CVSS score, but more importantly, the 'exploitability' and the 'criticality' of the asset. A medium-risk vulnerability on a public-facing server takes priority over a high-risk one on an isolated internal server. I work closely with the Operations team to schedule 'rolling updates' to maintain 99.9% uptime during these windows."
