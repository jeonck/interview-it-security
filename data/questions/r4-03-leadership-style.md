# Question

What is your preferred leadership style?

# Answer

"I am a 'Servant Leader.' I believe my primary job is to remove obstacles for my team so they can do their best work. I set high standards and clear expectations, but I also provide the tools, training, and support necessary to reach them. I lead by example - I won't ask my team to do anything I wouldn't do myself, whether that's working late during an incident or diving deep into technical problems. I balance autonomy with accountability: I trust my team to make decisions within their scope while maintaining visibility through regular check-ins and metrics. I adapt my style based on individual needs - some need more guidance, others more independence."
