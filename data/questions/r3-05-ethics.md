# Question

What would you do if you were asked to do something you felt was unethical?

# Answer

"Integrity is non-negotiable for me, especially in security where trust is everything. I would first seek to understand the full context - sometimes what appears unethical has a legitimate explanation I'm not aware of. If my concerns remain after that conversation, I would voice them clearly through proper internal channels - to my manager first, then to HR or ethics hotline if needed. I would refer to Samsung's code of conduct and relevant compliance frameworks. I firmly believe that a company's long-term reputation is far more valuable than any short-term gain. In security, cutting ethical corners inevitably leads to larger problems. I would document my concerns professionally and escalate appropriately."
